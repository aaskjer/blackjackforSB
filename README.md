3. Adjust arguments if needed.
    *(Optional)* Add the OBS overlay:

    2. In OBS: `Tools > Source Copy > Load scene > blackjack-OBS-import.json`
    3. Check if the images are still look fancy.

# **Commands**  
- `!blackjack <bet>`: Start a new game with your bet (or leave out the bet to use a random amount).
- `hit`: Draw an additional card.
- `stand`: End your turn and let the dealer play.
- `repeat`: for crowded chats so you can see your current cards again.


# **Changelogs**

**v7**
* Now, the game creates one shared deck per game instance. Dealer and the player draw from the same shared shuffled deck, unlike before.
* Renamed the Scene to `Blackjack - Game` to prevent overwriting old setups
* The Game now correctly set up a scene and a browser source for the cards in OBS. 
  * All you need to do is, drop the `cards` folder in the root folder of your streamer.bot and everything should be good.
  * The Design for the game is up to you, but you still can use `source copy` to import my copy of the game if you want to use my images.
